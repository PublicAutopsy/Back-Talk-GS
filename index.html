        <h3>What Is it?</h3>

<p>A SASS based, responsive grid system that allows you to change the amount of columns, the width of the entire working space, and the responsive breakpoints simply and easily.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

<p>Simply have SASS watching the file, and edit the variables at the top and the changes will be made to the entire system, allowing you to be freed from the size of your grid system of choice and design for whatever size you desire. </p>

<h3>Do I need to do anything to make it work?</h3>

<p>Back talk comes standard as a 16 column, 960px responsive grid, so its ready to use out of the box. Enjoy. </p>
