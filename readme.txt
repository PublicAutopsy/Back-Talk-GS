Back Talk GS is a SASS based grid system that enables you to change the amount of columns and the width of the entire working space with simple value changes. 

Simply have SASS watching the file, and edit the variables at the top and the changes will be made to the entire system, allowing you to be freed from the size of your grid system of choice and design for whatever size you desire. 

Back talk comes standard as a 16 column, 960px responsize grid, so its ready to use out of the box. Enjoy.
